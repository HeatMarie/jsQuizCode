# jsQuizCode

I saw that I would be doing a coding quiz, and I thought at first "How easy that will be, I just have to study." Little did I know I would be building the quiz, not taking one. and Alas, here we are. 

The criteria that should be met are the following: 

- When the user clicks the start button
- A timer should start
- and a question is presented 
- When a question is answered correctly, I am presented with another question
- When a question is answered incorrectly
- The time is subtracted from the clock
- When all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
- The game is over
- When the game is over then the user can save my initials and my score


The following link will deploy the page:

The hardest part of this was understanding the way to call and use arrays to do all the things. That and again time. There always seems to be a problem with time accelerating when you need to get things done. It's easy to spend endless hours trying to figure out one small problem only to find that you wrote quizStart instead of startQuiz. I slept on that one, and woke up the next day and went, duh. 

For this project, I completely ran out of time. It doesn't look the way I would like, - not even in the slightest - yet, the function is there.
